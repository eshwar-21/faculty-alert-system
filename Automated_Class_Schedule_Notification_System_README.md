# üìò Automated Class Schedule Notification System

This project automates class schedule management and SMS notifications for faculty using a **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**, **SIM800L GSM module**, **RTC DS3231**, and **LCD (I2C)** display.  

It displays current class periods on an LCD and automatically sends SMS alerts to faculty before their scheduled classes.

## üîß Serial Commands

When the **Mode Button (D7)** is **LOW**, you can interact through Serial Monitor:

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `U` | Update or View schedule |
| `T` | Set RTC time/date manually |
| `E` | Exit from manual mode |

### üßæ Example Serial Flow for Updating Schedule
```
Enter Sec (1-A, 2-B, or 3-C):
1
Enter period number (1 to 10):
2
Do you want to view (v) or update (u) the schedule?
u
Enter subject name:
Data Structures
Enter faculty name:
Dr. Ramesh
Enter faculty mobile number:
9876543210
Schedule updated successfully!
```

## ‚è∞ Daily Automation

- The RTC tracks time continuously.  
- During each class period:
  - LCD shows the **current period and subject**.
  - An **SMS** is sent to the respective faculty indicating their class details.
- Automatically resets period status at the end of the day.

## üì≤ Example SMS Output

```
Dear Sir/Madam,
You have a class to Sec-A
Subject: Data Structures
```

## üß© EEPROM Memory Map

| Section | EEPROM Start Address | Description |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Year A | 0 | Section A schedule data |
| Year B | 500 | Section B schedule data |
| Year C | 1000 | Section C schedule data |

Each period stores:
- Subject name (20 chars)
- Faculty name (20 chars)
- Mobile number (15 chars)

---

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| LCD not displaying | Wrong I2C address | Change `0x27` to `0x3F` in code |
| GSM not initializing | Low voltage | Use dedicated 4V‚Äì5V 2A power for SIM800L |
| SMS not sent | No SIM balance or network | Check signal and SMS pack |
| Time not correct | RTC battery weak | Replace CR2032 coin cell |
